This visualization presents an in-depth analysis of baby name trends in the United States from 1880 to 2023, highlighting shifts in popularity, diversity, and frequency. Over time, naming conventions have changed significantly, reflecting broader societal and cultural transformations.

The top visualization showcases the evolution of name diversity through a bubble chart, where each bubble represents a name, with its size corresponding to birth frequency. In the 1880s, fewer names dominated, resulting in a compact cluster. As time progresses, the number of unique names expands, creating a more dispersed pattern. By the 2000s and 2020s, name diversity peaks, suggesting that parents increasingly favor distinctive and less common names over traditional choices.

The bar chart on total births by gender reveals a steady increase from 1880 to the mid-20th century, followed by a sharp post-World War II Baby Boom (1945â€“1960), when annual births exceeded 4 million. After peaking in the 1950s-60s, birth rates stabilized and later declined post-2000, reflecting modern demographic trends such as lower birth rates and delayed parenthood.

The line chart on name diversity highlights how female names have always been more varied than male names. In the early 1900s, a few names dominated, but after the 1950s, naming diversity surged, especially for girls. This trend aligns with changing societal norms, encouraging uniqueness and creativity in naming.

The bottom line chart tracks the top-ranked names by gender and their percentage share of births. For females, "Mary" dominated the late 1800s with over 8% of female births, but later names like "Linda," "Lisa," "Jennifer," "Jessica," "Emily," "Isabella," "Emma," and "Olivia" took over. The overall decline in the dominance of top names reflects increased variety in baby name choices.

For males, "John" was the most common name in the early 20th century, later giving way to "Robert," "James," "David," "Michael," "Jacob," "Noah," and "Liam." Unlike female names, male names have remained more stable, with a slower decline in dominance.
